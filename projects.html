    <h2>Project Experience</h2>
    <h3>Freshman Projects: The Shot Clock</h3>
      <div class="shotclockcontainer">
      <figure><p>One of my first projects at CU was part of an introductory design course, where I worked with a team of three peers. The course emphasized core elements of the design process, including prototyping, testing, analysis, and technical communication. Our goal was to encourage physical activity as part of waking up, which led to the creation of the “Shot Clock.” We designed a polycarbonate basketball backboard integrated with an Arduino-based app to form an interactive alarm clock—one that required a successful basket to silence its sound and LED alarm. I was primarily responsible for the design and fabrication of the backboard and electronics enclosure, and I led the development of the team’s formal documentation.</p></figure>

       <h3>Circuits: Mini Skee Ball (Star Wars Edition)</h3>
      <div class="skeeballcontainer">
      <figure><p>As the final project for our basic circuits course final project, I collaborated with three teammates to create a Star Wars-themed tabletop skee ball game. The body was made from laser-cut acrylic, carefully painted to match the Star Wars theme, and the game was powered and programmed on an Arduino Uno. I led the circuit design and took charge of the custom PCB layout and fabrication, which functioned as an Arduino shield. I also wrote the majority of the Arduino code that controlled the game's logic. The circuit incorporated an Adafruit 4-digit 7-segment display, multiple piezo buzzers, IR sensors, LEDs, and the custom PCB. Each game lasted 90 seconds, with the coutdown displayed on the Adafruit screen and the Star Wars theme song playing through a piezo speaker. The objective was to throw balls through various holes; IR sensors behind each hole detected the motion, triggering corresponding LEDs and awarding points.</p></figure>

      <h3>Thermodynamics: Candle-Powered Heat Engine</h3>
      <div class="candlecontainer">
      <figure><p>Working in a team of four, I contributed significantly to the design and iterative troubleshooting of a homemade two-piston Stirling engine, which converts heat into mechanical work by spinning a shaft using balloon pistons. The design features a stationary regenerator made from steel wool inside a copper tube, ideally recycling thermal energy to increase engine efficiency.</p>
      <p>Material sourcing involved gathering low-cost components such as soup cans, balloons, steel wool, copper tubing, and heat-resistant epoxy. Much of the work focused on iterative prototyping - testing and refining the crankshaft, seals, flywheel weight distribution, and thermal management using ice inside the cold can.</p>
      <p>Thermodynamic calculations informed the optimization of balloon fit, shaft notches, and regenerator efficiency, resulting in an estimated engine efficiency of 78.5%. Challenges included manufacturing precision, creating airtight seals, minimizing friction, and limited quantative data, as our project scope did not include sensors.</p></figure>

      <h3>Projects for the Community: The Cropadile Farm Cart</h3>
      <div class="cartcontainer">
      <figure><p>As part of the second projects course in the Integrated Design Engineering program, my team of five collaborated with Boulder-local Off Beet Farms to address an everyday challenge faced by their workers: back pain caused by frequent bending while picking crops. We designed The Cropadile farm cart, a face-down support system made from wood, bike parts, and painter's tarp that allows farmers to move along crop beds while maintaining upper body mobility. The cart features a hammock-like design for comfortable body support, a stabilizing headrest, a unique tire connection system, and sturdy brackets to reinforce both the frame and wheels. It was designed to be easily built by farmers using readily available materials and customizable for individual needs.</p>
      <p>I took the lead in sourcing materials, visiting local vendors and shops around Boulder to find bike frames, wheels, and other components. Early in the process, we explored several design ideas - including a pin system inspired by weight machines - but discovered that welding those materials would be too difficult for professional welders, let alone college students. Throughout the process, I also contributed significantly to machining, fabricating the corner brackets, attaching wheels and forks to the frame, and securing the hammock component to the structure.</p></figure>

    <h3>Senior Design: The Transcanal Endoscopic Cochlear Implantation Instrument (TECII)</h3>
    <div class="TECIcontainer">
      <figure><p>As part of my senior capstone in the Integrated Design Engineering program, through the Mechanical Engineering department, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to develop the Transcanal Endoscopic Cochlear Implantation Instrument (TECII). This surgical tool was designed in partnership with an ENT surgeon from Children’s Hospital Colorado to reduce the invasiveness of traditional cochlear implant procedures. Our objective was to create a handheld device capable of guiding and deploying an electrode array through the ear canal, avoiding the need for more extensive surgery. My primary role focused on manufacturing — including material sourcing, selecting appropriate fabrication methods, coordinating production timelines, and planning the overall build process. I also supported CAD development in collaboration with the lead CAD engineer on our team. Additionally, I contributed to the electrical system, working on the deployment mechanism responsible for detaching the electrode array from the device and accurately placing it within the cochlea. This summary provides a general overview of the project, as more detailed descriptions are limited pending a preliminary patent filing.</p></figure>
