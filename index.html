    <h2>A Bit About Me!</h2>
    <img src="photos/moi.JPG" class="frontphoto" alt="Kelly in Ireland">
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a degree in Integrated Design (Mechanical) Engineering and a minor in Creative Technology and Design. My program emphasized project-based learning, providing extensive hands-on experience in prototyping, problem-solving, and collaborative teamwork. </p>

    <p>My project work spans sustainability initiatives to medical device development. Notably, I served as Manufacturing Engineer on a senior design team that developed a novel, less invasive cochlear implant insertion tool in partnership with Childrenâ€™s Hospital Colorado, which is currently under patent review. </p>

    <p>My expertise includes CAD (SolidWorks), mechanical design, manufacturing and fabrication techniques, data analysis (MATLAB, LabVIEW, Excel), and embedded systems (Arduino). I am particularly interested in roles involving medical technology, product development, engineering forensics, and data-driven problem solving where I can leverage both technical skills and creative thinking. </p>

    <p>I am excited to be using my coding skills to build this portfolio website from scratch!</p>
